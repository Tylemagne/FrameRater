FrameRater
==========

Lightweight cross-platform OpenGL-based framerate demonstration and assessment tool. The purpose of FrameRater is to test and demonstrate color displays, as well as offer a clear example of different framerates. FrameRater will be especially beneficial to software developers who claim arbitrarily low framerates are "good enough", as well as their soon-to-not-be customers and financial supporters.


Main Features
